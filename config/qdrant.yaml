# Collection defaults
# on_disk: false keeps vectors in RAM for fastest access.
# Capacity estimate (384-dim float32 embeddings):
#   ~1.5 KB per vector → ~512 MB limit supports ~340 K vectors.
# For larger deployments (>300 K memories) set on_disk: true to
# spill vectors to the mounted storage volume with minimal
# latency impact on modern NVMe/SSD storage.
